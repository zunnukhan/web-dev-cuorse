    <h1>Books</h1>
    <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images. Modern books are typically in codex
    format, composed of many pages that are bound together and protected by a cover. They were preceded by several older
    formats, such as the scroll and the tablet. The book publishing process is the series of steps involved in their
    creation and dissemination. Wikipedia</p>
